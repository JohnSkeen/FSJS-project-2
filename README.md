# Full Stack JavaScript Project 2

In this project we learned how to take a lot of information and make it readable by a user.  Instead of the full 54 students of this list showing I unobtrusively added pagination links to the bottom that separated the lists into groups of 10 or less.  In addition, for extra credit, I was able to create a search feature that allowed the user to browse the users via search - while still maintaining the pagination links appropriate to the search amount found.
